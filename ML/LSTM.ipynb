      "As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport's history, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century. The movie depicted well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself, from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust Americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing. What I loved best, however, is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes her son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior.Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament, the little liberties taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There's one little Disney moment at the pool table; otherwise, the viewer does not really think Disney. The ending, as in \"Miracle,\" is not some Disney creation, but one that only human history could have written.\n",

There's something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better.

Bret Carr dares to look inward, ask questions, and dig underneath the surface. By the nature of the film, it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well. It can take some courage to do this. I can see how some close-minded people might find this quite disturbing. However, I found it thought-provoking, much more than just entertainment. Bret Carr is truly an original filmmaker, with vision. I am curious to see what he will do next. Watch him. \n",

    "The original Beauty and the Beast was my favorite cartoon as a kid but it did have major plot holes. Why had no one else ever seen the castle or knew where it was? Didn't anyone miss the people who were cursed? All of that gets an explanation when the enchantress places her curse in the beginning. Why did Belle and her Father move to a small town? Her mother died and the father thought it as best to leave. I love the new songs and added lyrics to the originals. I like the way the cgi beast looks (just the face is CGi). I think Emma Watson is a perfect Belle who is outspoken, fearless, and different. The set design is perfect for the era in France.\n",
